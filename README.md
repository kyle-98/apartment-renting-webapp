# apartment-renting-webapp
Final Project for CS-389 | Spring 2021 | (PhP and MySQL Web Development) 

This website features a relational database design.  When registering, the user is given a unique ID in the users database alongside using Athony Ferrara's PhP Password Hashing API to securely store the user's password.  There is a database that contains all the apartments on the website where each apartment is also given a unique identifier.  When a user rents an apartment, the ID of the apartment and user are saved to a database alongside the main apartment database being updated to let the server know the apartment has been rented.  The user can also apply for a cancellation where an admin has to view the cancellation then either accept or deny based on their discretion.
